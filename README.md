## Project description

We are aiming to create big data solution capable of storing and processing delayed public transport data. The data will be stored in a distributed database and processed using Apache Spark. This differs from the available solutions by allowing users to query data not only in real time, but also historically. If the time allows, we will also create a dashboard that will allow users to query the data in a user-friendly way.
